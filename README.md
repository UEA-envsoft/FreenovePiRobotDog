<h2>Leg position tool</h2>
  <pre>
AlexDogPos.py                 a tool for converting leg angles to the freenove co-ordinate system  
                              It can store four positions and transition smoothly between them.  
AlexsDogPosToolui.py  and  
AlexsDogPosToolui.ui          Qt design files for above  
spike_legs3.png               the image in the GUI   
    </pre>
Place AlexDogPos.py, AlexsDogPosToolui.py and spike_legs3.png in Server directory
To run it type: <pre>python AlexDogPos.py</pre>

<h2>Local wireless keyboard, wagging tail and very crude autonomous movement </h2>

The code has a dependancy for evdev (https://python-evdev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): 

<ul>sudo pip3 install evdev</ul>

This code was written for the "Rii i8S Mini Keyboard" available from Amazon

evdev sees this keyboard as 4 separate devices: a keyboard, a mouse, a consumer control and a system control

If you wish to use this code with other controllers or keyboards you may well have to comment out some of the devices and remap some of the keyboard associations

Drop the following 4 files into the Server directory on the Pi. You may want to backup your copies of Action.py and Control.py first!

<pre>
lclkbd.py          the keyboard reading routine - this is the one you run: sudo python lclkbd.py
Control.py         modified version of the freenove file to wagging tail
Action.py          additional actions
wander.py          a quick stab at autonomous movement code - needs quite a bit of tinkering
                   try adjusting these values
                      aheadClear = 50
                      obstDanger = 35
